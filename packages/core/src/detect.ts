/**
 * Marks each unit (of one sentence) with `lang` or `base`. A unit the target knows and the base doesn't
 * is the target's, and the other way round. A unit both know ("em", "an", "to") goes by how common it is
 * in each: clearly more common in the target, the target's (Vietnamese "em", "di" next to English
 * "hello", "shopping": English has rare "em", "di"); far more common in the base, the base's ("the");
 * otherwise, and for units neither knows (names), the nearest decided neighbors' language when they agree,
 * else the target's (the text is mainly the target language: "an" next to English "the"). In languages
 * written in syllables, a base word that's a target word only once accents are added is weighed the same
 * way, using its accented form's frequency: "rat" is "rất" (far more common than English "rat"); close
 * calls ("met": mệt or English met) go to the target only when their neighbors are the target's ("Tôi met
 * quá"), so English stays English among English ("kem but it was": but, not bút). A word only the target
 * knows without its accents ("khong") is still the target's. The base is known through the translator, so
 * inflected forms count ("went", "cooked").
