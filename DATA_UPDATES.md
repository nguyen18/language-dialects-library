# Data updates

When each language's dictionary data was last updated from Wiktionary. The data is built from
[Kaikki.org](https://kaikki.org/)'s extraction of English Wiktionary; "Wiktionary data of" is the date
Kaikki last updated that language's file, "Downloaded" when we fetched it. Updated automatically by
`npm run build:data` (don't edit the table by hand). Published data packages carry the same dates in
`data/meta.json` (`source.lastModified`, `source.retrieved`). History is newest first; the build adds a
line when a language is added or its Wiktionary data changes, and other notes (like publishing) can be
added by hand.
